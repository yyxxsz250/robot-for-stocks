# robot-for-stocks
#This Program aims at building a chatbot which can help the user get information about stocks. 
#The chatbot should interpret the colloquial or literary sentences sent from users and get what 
#they mean and what they need to know, then create appropriate response to answer them. The responses 
#are also based on the statements of the conversation, which enables user to search in steps. 
#Technologies used in the chatbot contain RASA NLU, SPACY and other tools for Natural Language Recognition. 
#The code is based on PYTHON.
